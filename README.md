# C-

Welcome — this repository is where I share my C++ learning journey. I originally planned to create a folder named `C++`, but accidentally created `C-`. I like the name, so I decided to keep it as a small reminder that mistakes can turn into a feature.

## About

- **Purpose:** Track exercises, notes, and small projects as I learn C++.
- **Structure:** I'll group files into topic folders (examples, notes, exercises) and keep short commit messages describing what I learned.

## Why "C-"

The name happened by accident, but it feels memorable. Keeping `C-` is a fun, personal touch — it's the repository for progress, not perfection.

## How I'll use this repo

- Add small, focused examples (e.g., `firstday.cpp`).
- Write short notes or a brief explanation next to each example.
- Use commits to show progress over time.

## Quick start

To compile the example `firstday.cpp` (requires a C++ compiler like `g++`):

```bash
g++ firstday.cpp -o firstday && ./firstday
```

## Follow along / Contribute

If you want to follow my learning or suggest improvements, open an issue or send a PR. I appreciate feedback and small suggestions.

If you'd like, I can add sections for a roadmap, a list of topics to learn, or a CONTRIBUTING guide. Want me to add any of those now?
